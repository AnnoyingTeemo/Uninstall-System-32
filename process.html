    <div class="boxleft">
        The first part of the build process was choosing a program, I eventually decided to use blender to build my object in. I then started with a basic blue ISO sphere and pushed back one of the vertexes so that the object looked hollow from one side, I then placed a UV grey sphere inside the ISO sphere.</div>
    <div class="boxright">
        In the second lesson lesson I hollowed out the UV sphere and placed a hollowed out cylinder and some spheres to form an eyeball.</div>
    <div class="boxleft">In this part of the build process I added an eyebrow using a blue cube, I also moved some of the objects around so that they looked better.</div>
    <div class="boxright">In this part of the build process I started to play around with some potential animations for my object, eventually managing to spin my objects eye around 360&#8451;.</div>
    <div class="boxleft">In the next part of the build process I added a metalic texture to my UV sphere.</div>
    <div class="boxright">In the last part of the build process I added a texture to the ISO sphere and added an animation.</div>
